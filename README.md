## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 with Vite
- **UI Framework**: Mantine UI
- **Blockchain**: Allbridge Core SDK
- **Wallet**: Multi-wallet support with ethers.js (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, Exodus, Coinbase Wallet, Brave Wallet, etc.)
- **Icons**: Tabler Icons

## Supported Networks

- **Source**: Ethereum Mainnet
- **Destination**: Tron Mainnet
- **Tokens**: USDC, USDT (Ethereum) â†’ USDT (Tron)

## Configuration

The application uses default RPC URLs from the Allbridge Core SDK. This ensures:

1. No additional API keys or RPC endpoints required
2. Reliable connection to supported networks
3. Automatic fallback to official endpoints

## Security Considerations

- Always verify transaction details before confirming
- Double-check destination addresses
- Keep your private keys secure
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MetaMask not detected**

   - Ensure MetaMask is installed and unlocked
   - Refresh the page and try again

2. **Transaction fails**

   - Check if you have sufficient ETH for gas fees
   - Verify you have enough tokens to bridge
   - Ensure you're on the correct network (Ethereum mainnet)

3. **Token approval issues**
   - Some tokens require approval before bridging
   - Follow the approval process when prompted

### Error Messages

- **"Failed to connect wallet"**: Check Trust Wallet installation and permissions
- **"Invalid Tron address"**: Ensure the address starts with "T" and is 34 characters long
- **"Insufficient balance"**: Check your token and ETH balances
